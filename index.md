# Dyradia Codex

Welcome, wanderer.

This site is a **player-facing codex** for the world of Dyradia.  
Here you'll find information your characters *could reasonably know* or discover in play:

- Major regions & cities  
- Races, cultures, and factions  
- Broad history and myths  
- Known deities, patrons, and powers  
- A log of **in-world events** as your party uncovers them

> **Note:** Anything you see here is fair game for your character to reference.  
> Secrets, twists, and DM-only material live elsewhere and won't appear in this codex.
