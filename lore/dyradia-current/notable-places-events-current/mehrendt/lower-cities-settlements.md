**Nation:** Mehrendt  
**Type:** Major Port City / Naval Hub  
**Known For:** Fast passage to Gohlstout + Crownspire, shipyards, icewater trade

**Type:** Waystop Town / Caravan Node  
**Known For:** Inns, stables, courier relays, short routes to west coast  
**Triad Weather:** Neutral (goes with the flow)

### Overview

## 3) Hunter’s Guild “City”

### **The Stagspire Lodge-Complex**

_(locals just call it **Stagspire**)_

**Nation:** Mehrendt  
**Type:** Guildhold Settlement (semi-autonomous)  
**Known For:** Trappers, fishers, bounty contracts, cheap provisions  
**Triad Weather:** Resistance-leaning (independent), but not ideological

### Overview

Stagspire is a guildhold so large it behaves like a town: lodges, smokehouses, tanneries, docks, a contract hall, and a small army of hired blades. It’s where survival work becomes economy.

### Governance & Faces

- **Guildmaster Rannic Holt** - “fair prices, hard rules,” protects his people
    
- **Contract-Reader Merrow Sain** - assigns hunts, enforces terms, never forgets
    

### Rumors

### **Fort Glasswake**

_(alt names: **Westmarch Bastion**)_

**Nation:** Mehrendt  
**Type:** Fortified Training Grounds / Intelligence Station  
**Known For:** drills, war games, signals watch, quiet operations  
**Triad Weather:** Stasis-heavy

### Overview

Officially, Fort Glasswake is a training installation: disciplined troops, clean formations, and endless drills. Unofficially, it watches the sea and the southern routes—especially anything coming to and from the Church island.

- **“Quartermaster” Sera Dain** - supplies officer who asks too-smart questions

## 5) Church Island

### **The Pale Seat**

_(alt names: **Vesperhold**_

**Nation:** Church-aligned territory (not formally a nation)  
**Type:** Fortress-Island / Religious Hub  
**Known For:** cathedrals, relics, grim pilgrimages, hardline doctrine  
**Triad Weather:** Stasis and zealotry have easiest footing here

### Overview

The Pale Seat is what remains of the Church’s old grandeur: fewer cathedrals, more walls, and a faith sharpened by loss. Most who go do so for a reason: penance, power, relic-seeking, or politics. Everyone else pretends it doesn’t matter anymore.

### Governance & Faces

- **Castellan-Prelate Mourn Halveric** - fortress governor, polite fanaticism
    
- **Sister-Envoy Calenne** - outward-facing diplomat, “aid with hooks”
    

### Rumors

- Some vaults never reopened after the Fracture.
    
- They’re rebuilding influence via charity and orphanage networks.
    
- The island is abandoned.

## 6) Border-trade Hub

### **Dawnmere**

**Nation:** Free City / Neutral Trade Hub  
**Type:** River-mouth city on the Valecurrent estuary  
**Known For:** mixed cultures, arbitration, shipping, the Old Node Plaza  
**Triad Weather:** Convergence-friendly terrain; all sides contest it quietly

### Overview

Dawnmere is where borders blur into commerce. It survives by being useful to everyone and owned by no one (in public, anyway). Deals happen here long before wars do.

### Governance & Faces

- **The Treaty Wardens** - (civic arbitration council)
    
- **Harbor Syndics** - (merchant coalition that keeps the docks functioning)
    

### Rumors

- Decisions sometimes “resolve themselves” here with unsettling ease.
    
- A fixer network can move anyone out of the city overnight.
    
- Dawnmere is ruled by Fey’thra.

## 7) Mage’s College south of Crownspire, lakeside

### Lake name: **Lake Luminmere**
### College: **Luminmere Collegium**

_(alt names: **Spirelake Academy**)_

**Nation:** Mehrendt  
**Type:** Arcane Institute / Public Academy  
**Known For:** practical magic education, civic spellcraft, research ethics debates  
**Triad Weather:** contested (Stasis pressure outside; Renewal curiosity within)

### Overview

Luminmere Collegium is Mehrendt’s “acceptable face” of magic: sanctioned study, controlled practice, and a public argument that knowledge can be safe. It’s open to outsiders under rules… which makes it both respected and constantly targeted by those who fear what it represents.

### Governance & Faces

- **Provost Selwyn Arct** - careful reformer, speaks in measured promises
    
- **Warden-Registrar Hessa Quill** - enforces rules, tracks incidents, keeps the peace
    

### Rumors

- The Collegium has protocols for “anomalous resonance events.”
    
- Avalon recruiters frequent its outer circles.
    
- It trains Awoken.

## 8) Secondary campus near Fey’thra, east of Dawnmere

### **Greenward Annex**

**Type:** Satellite Campus / Field Institute  
**Known For:** stronger talent, practical resonance studies, Fey’thran collaboration rumors  
**Triad Weather:** Convergence-leaning (students/staff attracted to synthesis)

### Overview

Greenward Annex is smaller, sharper, and closer to the living edge of magic. Being near Fey’thra changes what students see as “normal.” The Annex produces some of the finest minds of the Collegium system; and a steady stream of political headaches.

### Governance & Faces

- **Dean Mirel Voss** - brilliant, stubborn, protective of her students
    
- **Fieldmaster Rennel Thorne** - runs expeditions and keeps casualties low
    

### Rumors

- The Annex has informal ties to Fey’thran scholars.
    
- Some students practice “unapproved” methods out of necessity.
    
- The Annex is a cult.

## 9) Royal Prison on the eastern coast of Mehrendt

### **Crownwater Penitentiary**

_(alt names: The Dreadworks)_

**Nation:** Mehrendt (royal authority), holds prisoners from Mehrendt and Gohlstout  
**Type:** Fortress-Prison carved into a colossal **basalt sink-ridge** above subterranean voids  
**Known For:** “no returns,” silence, brutal containment engineering  
**Triad Weather:** Stasis symbol (finality as policy)

### Overview

The Dreadworks is not just a prison: it’s a monument to your sins. Built into a natural basalt formation riddled with deep hollows, it’s designed to make escape feel like an insult to physics. People don’t talk about it often, but everyone knows what it means: if you’re sent there, the world is done negotiating with you.

# The Dreadworks as a Cliffside Fortress

## The Coast

That coastline is a punishment.

- The **Aurelian Expanse** drives cold, heavy currents south, and where they bend into **Crownwater Bay** they collide with warmer bay water and shoals.
    
- Result: **perpetual turbulence**; rogue swells, sudden fog, and waves that hit the cliff face like siege weapons.
    
- The rock is dark and stubborn (basalt/igneous), cut into sharp shelves and **knife-inlet coves** that are useless for normal harbors.
    

Locals don’t call it “stormy.” They call it **violent**.

### **A vertical prison-city carved into a sea cliff**

- **Top Level:** Administration, barracks, intake courts, warden’s tower
    
- **Mid Levels:** General population blocks, work yards cut into the cliff, chapels/interrogation rooms
    
- **Lower Levels (“The Undertier”):** solitary, high-risk cells, sound-damp corridors, water-drip darkness
    
- **Sea Level:** the _only_ viable access point for transport… and it’s barely viable
    

The cliff isn’t just scenery, **it’s the wall**.

From the sea, The Dreadworks looks like it’s been bolted onto the world.

Picture:

- A **black cliff wall** with a fortress _terraced_ into it like stacked teeth.
    
- **Iron buttresses** anchored into stone, with chains thicker than a person’s waist spanning gaps.
    
- Narrow windows: not for light, but **for oversight**.
    
- At the highest tier: a keep-like structure whose silhouette breaks the skyline like a cracked crown.
    

On some nights, waves throw white spray high enough that it looks like the fortress is burning.

## Getting into The Dreadworks, Route A: The Iron Road (land approach)

A single engineered road clings to the cliffs from inland, like a military supply line.

- It’s narrow, switch-backed, and heavily patrolled.
    
- Parts of it are **covered galleries** (roofed stone corridors) because rockfalls and storm-winds are normal.
    
- If a prisoner escapes onto the Iron Road, they haven’t escaped; they’ve entered a controlled funnel.
    

## Getting into The Dreadworks, Route B: The Blackwater Intake (sea approach)

There’s no “port.” There’s a **cleft**.

A narrow, partially roofed sea-cut inlet exists directly beneath the prison, where:

- The sea enters violently, but the inlet geometry breaks the worst of it.
    
- There are **chain-booms** and iron gates that can close the inlet during bad tides.
    
- Prison ships don’t dock, instead, they are **winched** in, clamped, and unloaded fast.
    

A transfer at the Blackwater Intake is a timed ritual:

- The sea decides whether you’re on schedule.
    

## The Chainlift

A vertical lift platform (like a fortress freight elevator) that hauls:

- prisoners
    
- supplies
    
- coffins  
    between sea level and mid-tier.
    

It moves slow, groaning, always above open air.  
Escaping it isn’t “jump and run.”  
It’s “fall into ocean teeth.”

## The Breakwater Galleries

A series of arched stone corridors exposed to sea spray.  
They’re “outside,” but still inside the prison.  
Guards love walking prisoners through them because it’s terrifying:

- you can see freedom
    
- and you can’t reach it
    

## The Undertier

The lowest cell tier where the stone sweats salt.  
It’s where people go when the state doesn’t want a trial, a martyr, or a mess.

Rumor says you can hear the sea _through the walls_ down there.

Prisoners arrive hooded, hearing nothing but waves and chains.  
Then the hood comes off and they see the cliff face above them:

> a fortress that looks like it can’t exist, and yet it’s already waiting.

### Governance & Faces

- **Warden Inquisitor Jast Malrec** - calm, procedural, terrifyingly lawful
    
- **The Chainward Host** - elite guards trained for riots, breaches, and “containment”
    

### Rumors

- There are cells designed for “anomalous prisoners.”
    
- Some inmates are held without public record.
    
- No one has ever escaped.

## 10) Bayside Fishing Colony (SW corner of Great Bay)

### **Saltveil Commune**

_(alt names: **Reedharbor**)_

**Nation:** Mehrendt (autonomous by tradition)  
**Type:** Fishing Colony / Communal Shorehold  
**Known For:** seafood supply, ship provisioning, calm neutrality  
**Triad Weather:** Neutral… but strangely insulated

### Overview

Saltveil is the kind of place that stays out of trouble by being indispensable. It feeds Mehrendt, trades quietly with neighbors, and maintains a cooperative culture that outsiders find almost unsettling in its calm. You don’t hear scandals from Saltveil. You barely hear _anything_.

### Governance & Faces

- **The Netcouncil** - elders and captains who decide quotas and disputes
    
- **Speaker Liora “Net-Song”** - voice of the commune, gentle but immovable
    

### Rumors

- Saltveil has strict rules about violence on its docks.
    
- The commune “pays” someone to keep pirates away.
    
- They’re secretly rich beyond measure.
