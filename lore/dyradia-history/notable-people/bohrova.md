# 📜 **Bohrova**

_The Sage of the Interstice_  
_(Archival Entry – Compiled Accounts)_

---

## **Overview**

**Name:** Bohrova  
**Era:** Pre-Fracture (exact dates disputed)  
**Known Titles:**

- The Interstitial Sage
    
- The First Conduit
    
- The World-Bridger
    
- The Heretic Architect _(Church designation)_
    

**Status:** Disappeared (Fate Unknown)

Bohrova is widely regarded as the most influential mortal scholar in recorded Dyradian history. His work reshaped travel, education, infrastructure, and the mortal understanding of magic itself. Though celebrated by most cultures, his legacy remains deeply contested, particularly by religious institutions descended from the Church of Prim.

## **Major Contributions**

**The Interstitial Network** _(Terminology varies)_

Bohrova is credited with the creation of a vast system of stabilized magical passages allowing accelerated travel across Dyradia. These passages did not transport travelers to another plane, but rather through a **contained liminal space** existing between Dyradia and the realm associated with the Dyra.

Common scholarly terms include:

- **The Interstice**
    
- **The Veiled Way**
    
- **The Liminal Channel**
    
- **The Between**
    
- **The Dyric Span**
    

Travel through the Interstice reduced months of overland travel to days, radically altering trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange. Over decades, the network facilitated unprecedented growth and interconnection among civilizations.

Notably:

- Travelers never directly entered the Dyra plane
    
- The space was described as _contained_, navigable, and directional
    
- Only Bohrova is believed to have fully understood its mechanics
    

Many Interstitial nodes remain functional following the Fracture, though their behavior has become unpredictable.

### **The Academic Awakening**

Through his communion with the Dyra and exposure to non-mortal modes of perception, Bohrova introduced transformative advancements in:

- Mathematics
    
- Architecture
    
- Astronomy
    
- Medicine
    
- Philosophy
    
- Artistic theory
    

This period, often referred to as **The Awakening**, marked a transition from myth-driven tradition to structured inquiry. Institutions of learning expanded rapidly, and standardized notation systems emerged that remain foundational today.

## **Tiered Knowledge Accounts**

---

### **Tier 0 — Common Knowledge**

_(No roll required)_

> _“Bohrova was a great wizard who helped the world prosper before the Fracture. He made travel easier, taught people new ways to build and learn, and then vanished before the war destroyed everything.”_

Most people believe:

- Bohrova was a benevolent genius
    
- He lived long ago
    
- His works were lost or damaged in the war
    
- His disappearance spared him from blame
    

This version is comforting, tidy, and incomplete.

### **Tier 1 — Familiar History**

_(Low DC History / Educated Background)_

> _“Bohrova was a planar scholar whose discoveries led to the creation of the Interstitial travel network and the spread of advanced sciences. His teachings accelerated civilization, but also brought mortals dangerously close to forces they did not fully understand.”_

Known at this level:

- The Interstice existed _between_ planes
    
- Travel was regulated and structured
    
- The Awakening reshaped multiple kingdoms
    
- The Church of Prim viewed Bohrova as dangerous
    

Students are often taught that Bohrova’s work was “too much, too fast.”

### **Tier 2 — Archival / Scholarly Record**

_(Moderate–High DC History, Libraries, Feythran or Gohlstout sources)_

> _“Primary records indicate Bohrova did not merely study planar energies, but lived for extended periods within a stabilized liminal environment. His understanding of distance, scale, and resonance far exceeded contemporary magical theory.”_

Archival texts confirm:

- The Interstice was **engineered**, not discovered
    
- Its geometry did not correspond to Dyradian space
    
- Some nodes were deliberately left unfinished
    
- Bohrova restricted access to certain regions intentionally
    

Additionally:

- Early Awakening mathematics show non-Euclidean influence
    
- Architectural designs mirror Interstitial flow patterns
    
- Several disciplines emerged _solely_ because of Bohrova’s teachings
    

Scholars argue whether the Fracture damaged the network — or merely revealed its instability.

### **Tier 3 — Obscure / Suppressed Knowledge**

_(High DC, Restricted Texts, Elven Oral Record, Dwarven Vaults)_

> _“Elven records describe Bohrova as neither fully mortal nor entirely unchanged by his time within the Interstice. His prolonged exposure altered his perception of causality, distance, and continuity.”_

Deep records suggest:

- Bohrova could navigate the Interstice **without anchors**
    
- He may have perceived Dyradia as a _node_, not a world
    
- Some Interstitial paths do not reconnect to known locations
    
- The Dyra plane was not his destination — merely adjacent
    

Most disturbingly:

- Some believe Bohrova did not _disappear_
    
- He may have withdrawn beyond conventional spatial relation
    
- Or became bound to maintaining—or restraining—the system itself
    

Certain fringe theories posit:

- The current instability is not decay
    
- It is **interference**
    
- As though something long held in check is pushing back
    

---

## **Post-Fracture State of the Interstitial Network**

Following the Fracture:

- Some nodes collapsed entirely
    
- Others function at reduced capacity
    
- Several reconnect to unfamiliar regions of Dyradia
    
- A small number lead to places not recorded on any map
    

Rumors persist of:

- Travelers returning _changed_
    
- Journeys taking longer internally than externally
    
- Paths that move _deeper_ instead of across
    

Modern authorities heavily regulate Interstitial use.

## **Cultural Impact**

### **Mehrendt**

- Credits Bohrova for its rise as a trade power
    
- Publicly honors his contributions
    
- Privately avoids his deeper theories
    

### **Feythra**

- Remembers Bohrova as a _listener_
    
- Treats his name with reverence and caution
    
- Preserves unedited accounts of his work
    

### **Gohlstout**

- Archives his mathematics and schematics
    
- Refuses to speculate on his fate
    
- Notes increased anomalies near deep vault passages
    

### **Avalon**

- Reveres Bohrova as proof that magic should not be controlled
    
- Views the Fracture as political failure, not scholarly hubris
    

---

## **Current Scholarly Consensus**

There is none.

Bohrova is simultaneously remembered as:

- A savior
    
- A fool
    
- A victim
    
- A warning
    

What _is_ agreed upon is this:

> **Dyradia as it exists today would not exist without Bohrova.**  
> And whatever is now destabilizing the world is touching something he once held together.
