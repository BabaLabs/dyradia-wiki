# 📜 **Ezericht La’Monte**

_The Unwilling Heir_

---

## **Overview**

**Titles:** King of Mehrendt (posthumous recognition varies)  
**Birth Status:** Illegitimate Royal Heir  
**Era:** The Fracture  
**Status:** Deceased

Ezericht La’Monte is one of the most controversial figures of the Fracture era. Raised as an orphan and unaware of his lineage, Ezericht was drawn into the conflict through political manipulation, becoming both catalyst and casualty of the Church of Prim’s final gambit for power.

---

### **Tier 0 — Common Knowledge**

> _“Ezericht was the king who brought ruin upon Mehrendt, whether he meant to or not.”_

Most people believe:

- He was weak or manipulated
    
- His actions accelerated the Fracture
    
- His reign was brief and disastrous
    

His humanity is rarely discussed.

---

### **Tier 1 — Familiar History**

> _“Ezericht was revealed as a hidden heir during the Fracture and became central to a legitimacy crisis engineered by the Church.”_

Known facts:

- His blood was used in binding rituals
    
- He was captured by the Church
    
- An impostor nearly claimed the throne in his name
    

His death is framed as tragic, but inevitable.

---

### **Tier 2 — Archival Record**

> _“Primary sources indicate Ezericht was deliberately isolated, misled, and psychologically destabilized prior to his forced involvement.”_

Archival notes reveal:

- He was never intended to rule
    
- His role was symbolic, not strategic
    
- His death resolved the Church’s need for legitimacy
    

This reframes him as a victim, not a failure.

---

### **Tier 3 — Suppressed Knowledge**

> _“Private correspondence suggests Ezericht understood the manipulation moments before his death — and chose not to resist.”_

Why remains unknown.

---

**Affiliation:** Mehrendt Military (former), Rebel Coalition  
**Attunement:** Fire (Awoken)  
**Status:** Deceased

Zwarf was a decorated military officer who defected from Mehrendt’s forces after uncovering the Church’s internal machinations. His strategic brilliance and moral absolutism made him indispensable — and dangerous.

---

### **Tier 0 — Common Knowledge**

> _“Z was the Awoken who burned a city.”_

That is how most people remember him.

---

### **Tier 1 — Familiar History**

> _“Z was a military leader whose Awakening during the Fracture caused catastrophic destruction.”_

Known facts:

- He was Fire-attuned

- His actions justified the Church’s final crusade
    

---

### **Tier 2 — Archival Record**

> _“Records show Z’s manifestation occurred after prolonged suppression, emotional trauma, and exposure to planar destabilization.”_

Archival reinterpretation:

- He was not unstable by nature
    
- He was breaking under impossible conditions
    
- His command saved countless lives before his fall
    

---

### **Tier 3 — Obscure Knowledge**

> _“Some rebel accounts insist Z knew what would happen — and chose to stand where the damage would be contained.”_

There is no consensus.
