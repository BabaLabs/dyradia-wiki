# 📜 **Historical Eras of Dyradia**

_Standard Scholarly Chronology_

Modern historians divide recorded Dyradian history into several broadly accepted eras. While exact dates vary by source, the following structure is widely used across institutions.

---

## **I. The Primordial Age**

_(Pre-History)_

> _“Before kingdoms, before law — when the world was still being negotiated.”_

### **Overview**

The Primordial Age encompasses the time when the Dyra maintained direct stabilizing influence over elemental and magical forces. Mortal civilizations existed in scattered forms, largely nomadic or proto-settled, and lacked formalized magic or governance.

### **Common Understanding**

- The Dyra shaped the world
    
- Mortals survived within it
    
- Magic existed, but was incoherent
    

### **Scholarly Notes**

- No reliable mortal records survive
    
- Elven oral tradition is the primary source
    
- Dwarven geological records confirm unusual stability
    

This era ends not with catastrophe, but with **withdrawal**.

## **II. The Age of Convergence**

_(Early Civilization)_

> _“When the world learned to stand upright.”_

### **Overview**

This era marks the rise of permanent settlements, early kingdoms, and proto-religious structures. Mortals began forming theories about the world, often mythologizing the Dyra.

## **IV. The Ascendancy of the Church**

_(Late Bohrovan → Early Fracture)_

> _“When fear found structure.”_

### **Overview**
