# 📜 **The Interstice**

_Also known as: The Veiled Way, The Between, The Dyric Span_

---

## **Overview**

**Type:** Liminal Transit Phenomenon  
**Originator:** Bohrova  
**Status:** Partially Functional (Post-Fracture)  
**Access:** Regulated, Restricted, or Lost (Varies by Region)

The **Interstice** is a stabilized liminal space existing between the material world of Dyradia and the planar domain associated with the Dyra. It was engineered as a means of long-distance travel, allowing individuals and caravans to traverse vast distances in a fraction of the time required by conventional routes.

Contrary to popular belief, travelers do not enter the Dyra plane itself. Instead, they pass through a **contained in-between space**, where spatial relationships differ from those of the material world.

## **Function and Structure**

### **Transit Principles**

- Distance within the Interstice does not correspond linearly to distance in Dyradia
    
- Travel is directional and guided via anchored nodes
    
- Time passage is generally consistent, though deviations have been recorded
    
- Entry and exit points are fixed unless destabilized
    

The Interstice is accessed through **anchored thresholds**, commonly referred to as _gates_, _spans_, or _nodes_. These structures were placed strategically across Dyradia during the height of Bohrova’s influence.

### **Common Knowledge**

_(No roll required)_

> _“The Interstice is an old magic road. You step in one place and come out somewhere far away. It’s slower than it used to be, but it still works — mostly.”_

Most people believe:

- The Interstice is just a magical shortcut
    
- It was stronger “back in the old days”
    
- Occasional mishaps are expected
    
- Only fools or smugglers use unstable nodes
    

The Interstice is treated as useful, but unremarkable.

## **Post-Fracture Behavior**

Since the Fracture:

- Several nodes collapsed entirely
    
- Others now cover reduced distances
    
- Some reconnect to unfamiliar regions
    
- A handful produce no exit at all
    

Modern scholars classify nodes as:

- **Stable** – predictable, regulated
    
- **Degraded** – functional with anomalies
    
- **Severed** – inert or destroyed
    
- **Unbound** – destination unknown
    

Use of Unbound nodes is universally discouraged.

## **Cultural Perception**

### **Mehrendt**

- Uses stable nodes for trade and diplomacy
    
- Heavily regulates access
    
- Downplays anomalies
    

### **Feythra**

- Views the Interstice as inherently dangerous
    
- Maintains ancient wards near forest-adjacent nodes
    
- Tracks disturbances carefully
    

### **Gohlstout**

- Records Interstitial fluctuations meticulously
    
- Notes resonance interference deep underground
    
- Restricts experimentation
    

### **Avalon**

- Uses degraded and unbound nodes strategically
    
- Considers the risk acceptable
    
- Believes the Interstice should not be controlled

## **Current Scholarly Disputes**

Unresolved questions include:

- Whether the Interstice is self-sustaining
    
- If it is expanding or contracting
    
- Whether it is reacting to external interference
    
- If Bohrova’s absence is the cause — or the safeguard
    

There is growing concern that the Interstice is no longer merely a transit system, but an **active participant** in the world’s instability.

## **Common Rumors**

_(Unverified)_

- Some nodes lead “too far”
    
- Time passes differently in deeper paths
    
- New exits are appearing where none existed
    
- The Interstice is beginning to remember something
