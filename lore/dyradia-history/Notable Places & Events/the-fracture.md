---

## **Overview**

**Type:** Historical Cataclysm / Multi-Front Conflict  
**Era:** Late Pre-Fracture → Early Post-Fracture Transition  
**Duration:** Approximately three decades (estimates vary)  
**Primary Participants:**

- The Church of Prim
    
- Multiple sovereign states and factions
    
- Independent magical actors
    
- The Awoken
    

**Outcome:**

- Collapse of centralized religious authority

- Disappearance of the Awoken
    
- Destabilization of planar structures
    

The **Fracture** marks the single most consequential event in recorded Dyradian history. It was not a single war, nor a unified rebellion, but a cascading failure of trust, authority, and metaphysical stability.

---

## **General Description**

The Fracture emerged from escalating tension between religious doctrine, political legitimacy, and the growing influence of unmediated magic. While often described as inevitable, archival evidence suggests the conflict was **engineered**, accelerated, and exploited by those seeking absolute control.

The era culminated in widespread devastation, including the destruction of a district within Mehrendt’s capital and the irreversible severance of Dyradia’s deeper magical coherence.
