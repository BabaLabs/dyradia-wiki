# 📜 **The Fracture**

_Also known as: The Purification, The Sundering, The Great Loss

---

## **Overview**

**Type:** Historical Cataclysm / Multi-Front Conflict  
**Era:** Late Pre-Fracture → Early Post-Fracture Transition  
**Duration:** Approximately three decades (estimates vary)  
**Primary Participants:**

- The Church of Prim
    
- Multiple sovereign states and factions
    
- Independent magical actors
    
- The Awoken
    

**Outcome:**

- Collapse of centralized religious authority
    
- Severe loss of life and infrastructure
    
- Permanent alteration of magical behavior
    
- Disappearance of the Awoken
    
- Destabilization of planar structures
    

The **Fracture** marks the single most consequential event in recorded Dyradian history. It was not a single war, nor a unified rebellion, but a cascading failure of trust, authority, and metaphysical stability.

---

## **General Description**

The Fracture emerged from escalating tension between religious doctrine, political legitimacy, and the growing influence of unmediated magic. While often described as inevitable, archival evidence suggests the conflict was **engineered**, accelerated, and exploited by those seeking absolute control.

The era culminated in widespread devastation, including the destruction of a district within Mehrendt’s capital and the irreversible severance of Dyradia’s deeper magical coherence.

## **Tiered Knowledge Accounts**

---

### **Tier 0 — Common Knowledge**

_(No roll required)_

> _“The Fracture was the war that ended the age of reckless magic. The Church fell, the Awoken vanished, and the world survived — barely.”_

Most people believe:

- Magic caused the war
    
- The Church went too far, but meant well
    
- The destruction proved magic was too dangerous
    
- The past should remain buried
    

This version is emotionally simple and culturally reinforced.

---

### **Tier 1 — Familiar History**

_(Low DC History, Soldier, Cleric, or Educated Background)_

> _“The Fracture was a prolonged conflict between the Church of Prim and various factions opposing its authority, culminating in internal collapse and magical catastrophe.”_

At this level, it is known that:

- The Church attempted to control magic through force
    
- Rebel forces formed across Dyradia
    
- Several high-ranking Church leaders were killed
    
- The Awoken became symbols of fear
    

Most texts emphasize **chaos**, not culpability.

---

### **Tier 2 — Archival / Scholarly Record**

_(Moderate–High DC History, Institutional Access)_

> _“Primary records indicate the Church of Prim deliberately provoked crisis conditions to justify consolidation of power, including the use of blood-binding magic and false-flag operations.”_

Archival consensus (where it exists) includes:

- The exposure of a hidden royal heir was orchestrated
    
- The Church manipulated legitimacy rituals
    
- Armed conflict was accelerated intentionally
    
- Opposition forces were fragmented but coordinated
    

Confirmed outcomes:

- All known high-ranking Church authorities were slain during the conflict
    
- The Cardinal alone evaded capture
    
- Losses among rebel forces were severe and underreported
    

This tier establishes **intent**, not just consequence.

---

### **Tier 3 — Suppressed / Contested Knowledge**

_(High DC, Restricted Archives, Feythran or Gohlstout Sources)_

> _“Several sealed accounts describe the Fracture as a failure of containment rather than ideology — a moment when the world’s deeper structures could no longer bear the strain imposed upon them.”_

Deep records reveal:

- The destruction in Mehrendt coincided with planar destabilization
    
- The Awoken involved exhibited awareness of impending failure
    
- The Interstice destabilized simultaneously across multiple nodes
    
- Magical behavior changed _globally_, not locally
    

This reframes the Fracture as:

> A metaphysical rupture triggered by human action.

---

### **Tier 4 — **Hidden Knowledge** (Extremely Rare)**

_(Access requires extraordinary means, trust, or non-human testimony)_

> _“One figure stands absent from official histories — mentioned only as a traitor, butcher, or architect of atrocity. This absence is deliberate.”_

Fragmentary records suggest:

- **Maeleus** was embedded within enemy ranks for years
    
- His actions were instrumental in dismantling the Church’s inner structure
    
- He knowingly accepted irreversible damnation of his name
    
- His survival was never part of the plan
    

Most critically:

> The collapse of the Church’s hierarchy could not have occurred without him.

Those who knew the truth:

- Spoke of him only in whispers
    
- Took oaths of silence
    
- Allowed history to condemn him
    

Over time:

- Most witnesses died
    
- Records were sealed or destroyed
    
- Reverence faded into myth, then absence
    

To the world, Maeleus is a monster.  
To the few who remember, he is a **necessary sacrifice**.

## **The Death of the Church’s Leadership**

It is historically verified that:

- The Cardinal survived the Fracture
    
- All other senior Church authorities perished
    
- Many died at the hands of a unified rebel force
    

The exact circumstances of their deaths vary by source.

The Cardinal’s disappearance following the conflict remains unresolved.

---

## **Consequences of the Fracture**

- Permanent alteration of magic’s behavior
    
- End of the Academic Awakening
    
- Collapse of Interstitial stability
    
- Disappearance of the Awoken
    
- Cultural fear of unmediated power
    

No post-Fracture generation has lived without its shadow.

---

## **Modern Interpretation**

Today, the Fracture is:

- Taught cautiously
    
- Moralized heavily
    
- Politically weaponized
    
- Rarely interrogated deeply
    

Few wish to reopen its wounds.

Fewer still are prepared to accept that:

> The world did not heal — it adapted.

## **Common Rumors**

_(Unverified)_

- The Cardinal is still alive
    
- The Fracture is not finished
    
- Certain names were erased deliberately
    
- Someone is trying to reconnect what was broken
