As Recorded in the Third Century After the Fracture, year 39...

The world of **Dyradia** is old; older than most care to remember, and older still than most stories dare to admit. It is a land shaped not only by kings and wars, but by belief, defiance, and the slow, uneasy relationship between mortals and power.

*To live in Dyradia is to live in the long shadow of history.*

# Of Kingdoms and Peoples

In the heart of the continent lies **Mehrendt**, the greatest of human kingdoms, vast and varied. Its cities hum with trade and ambition; its countryside feeds the world. Mehrendt has always been a place of convergence: of races, cultures, and creeds: and nowhere is that more apparent than in its capital, where temples, academies, guildhalls, and courts crowd against one another in uneasy coexistence.

To the east stretch the ancient forests of **Feythra**, homeland of the Elves. There, stone gives way to root and canopy, and history is remembered not in books, but in song, ritual, and living memory. Feythrans have never forgotten the age when the world’s foundations were closer to the surface, when magic was not merely practiced, but lived. Even now, their groves and sanctuaries hum with a quiet reverence for forces most mortals only half understand.

In the northern mountains stands **Gohlstout**, the dwarven kingdom carved into stone itself. Its halls are older than most nations, its traditions older still. The dwarves of Gohlstout concern themselves little with the disputes of surface faiths; their loyalty is to craft, lineage, and the enduring truth of what can be shaped by hand and hammer. Many secrets of the past are said to lie buried in their vaults; some deliberately forgotten, others simply waiting.

To the southwest, where borders are uncertain and maps grow unreliable, lie the lands claimed, for lack of a better word, by **Avalon**. Neither kingdom nor church, Avalon is a people bound by resistance. Born of opposition to religious rule and centralized power, the Avalonians are warriors, wanderers, and mages alike. They do not deny magic; they defend it, even as the world grows increasingly afraid of its cost.

Threaded through all of this, touching every nation without truly belonging to any, is the long legacy of the Church of Prim.

# Of Faith and Fear

The **Church of Prim** rose in the aftermath of catastrophe, preaching a simple, dangerous truth: that the world was *wounded by magic*.

According to Church doctrine, the **Dyra**: the ancient Primordials, embodiments of elemental forces... erred grievously when they allowed mortals to draw too closely upon the raw foundations of creation. Worse still, they claim, was the work of **Bohrova**, a sage of legendary brilliance who unlocked the means by which humans could commune with those forces directly.

To most of the world, Bohrova was a benefactor. A visionary. A pioneer whose discoveries elevated civilization, eased suffering, and brought prosperity. To the Church, he was the architect of mankind’s fall: a man who blurred the boundary between mortal and divine, and in doing so, tainted existence itself.

*The truth, as ever, is more complicated.*

What is known is this: in the age before the Fracture, magic flowed differently. Some individuals, later called the **Awoken**, were able to draw upon power not through prayer or study, but through attunement. They were living conduits, shaped by elemental resonance. Their abilities were extraordinary. Their cost was immense.

# Of the Fracture

The war that followed is remembered by many names. The Church calls it **The Purification**. The elves remember it as **The Sundering**. Dwarven records refer to it simply as The Great Loss.

At its center stood a young man named **Ezericht La’Monte**, a name now half-buried beneath layers of myth and cautionary tale. Raised as an orphan, Ezericht was unknowingly drawn into a conflict far larger than himself: a conflict engineered by those who sought power through blood, legacy, and control.

Through deception and manipulation, the Church revealed the existence of royal blood they had long sought, using it to justify their claim over the throne of Mehrendt. Through betrayal, fear, and desperation, Ezericht was forced to confront a truth that shattered both his life and the kingdom.

*And when the truth broke, so too did the world.*

The destruction of a district of Mehrendt’s capital, wrought by an Awoken driven beyond restraint, became the moment history pivoted. The horror of that day gave the Church the weapon it needed: proof, in the eyes of many, that magic could not be trusted.

The war that followed devastated nations and ideals alike. When it ended, the Church lay broken, its authority shattered... but its philosophy endured.

The connection between **Dyradia** and the deeper sources of magic was damaged. *Not destroyed*. Damaged.

The Awoken vanished. No new ones have appeared since.

*Magic remained—but it changed.*

# The World Today

Centuries have passed.

Magic still exists, but it no longer feels whole. Spells work, yet they feel thinner. Enchantments fade. Rituals require adjustment. Scholars argue endlessly over why, and none can fully agree.

Most people do not speak of it openly, but everyone knows something is wrong.

The **Church of Prim** no longer rules as it once did, but its influence lingers in law, superstition, and fear. The elves watch the land with growing unease. Dwarven records speak of disturbances deep underground. In Avalon, old warriors whisper that the world is beginning to sound like it once did...*before* everything broke.

*And now, quietly, without warning, the signs grow harder to ignore.*

Magic misbehaves. Old places stir. Phenomena thought impossible reappear, twisted and unstable. It is as though something has begun to pull at the broken edges of the world; reconnecting chains that were never meant to be reforged.

# Where You Stand

You are not heroes of legend... *yet*.
You are not Awoken, saints, or kings.

You are people who live in the long aftermath of a world-changing age. You were born into a Dyradia shaped by fear, compromise, and half-truths. The past is known, but not understood. The future is uncertain, but pressing closer with every passing year.

Whatever you believe about magic, faith, or history, one thing is clear:

*The world is changing...again

And this time, there may be no one left who remembers how to stop it.
